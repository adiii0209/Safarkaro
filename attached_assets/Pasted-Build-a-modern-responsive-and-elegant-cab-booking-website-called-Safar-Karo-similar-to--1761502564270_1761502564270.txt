Build a **modern, responsive, and elegant cab booking website** called **“Safar Karo”**, similar to *Savaari.com*, offering **airport transfers, outstation rides, and local rentals** with a sleek and travel-themed interface. The site should feature a **deep blue (#002B5B)** and **golden yellow (#F9C425)** color palette, clean “Poppins” or “Inter” typography, and smooth animations using **Framer Motion** or **AOS**. The **navigation bar** will display the logo “Safar Karo” and menus for *Home, Airport, Outstation, Rentals, Destinations, About,* and *Contact*, with “Login” and “Book Now” buttons on the right. The **hero section** will show a tagline “Safar Karo — Reliable Rides, Anytime, Anywhere.” beside a car illustration and a booking form with fields for pickup, drop, date & time, trip type (Airport / Outstation / Rental), and a “Search Cabs” button. Below, horizontally scrollable sections will display content: the **Services section** will include scrollable cards for Airport Transfers, Outstation Trips, Local Rentals, and Corporate Travel, each with an icon, short description, and “Book Now” button; the **Popular Destinations section** will showcase routes such as *Kolkata → Digha (185 km, 4 hr, ₹2,999)*, *Kolkata → Jamshedpur (285 km, 5.5 hr, ₹3,999)*, *Kolkata → Puri (500 km, 8 hr, ₹6,999)*, *Kolkata → Shantiniketan (165 km, 3.5 hr, ₹2,799)*, and *Kolkata → Mandarmani (180 km, 4 hr, ₹3,099)*, all in a horizontally scrollable carousel with images and “Book Now” buttons. A horizontally scrollable **Why Choose Us section** will list advantages like Verified Drivers, 24×7 Support, Transparent Pricing, Clean Cars, and Easy Cancellations, followed by a **Testimonials carousel** showing user reviews. The site should include smooth navigation, mobile responsiveness, subtle shadows, rounded corners, animated transitions, and floating WhatsApp/Call buttons. A footer will show quick links, contact info, and social icons, and SEO metadata will highlight “Safar Karo – Book Airport, Outstation & Rental Cabs from Kolkata and Beyond.”
